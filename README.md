What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering incorporates systematic methodologies, rigorous testing, and project management practices, focusing on building scalable and maintainable software solutions. In contrast, traditional programming often involves ad-hoc coding without formal processes, testing, or consideration of broader design principles and project management techniques.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements Gathering and Analysis: Collecting and documenting project requirements to understand what the software should accomplish.

Design: Creating detailed specifications for the software architecture, user interface, and modules based on gathered requirements.

Implementation: Writing code and integrating modules to develop the software product.

Testing: Rigorously testing the software to identify and fix defects, including unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.

Deployment: Deploying the software to the production environment for end-user access.

Maintenance: Addressing defects and making updates or enhancements to meet changing requirements after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile Model:

Iterative and incremental approach focusing on customer satisfaction, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
Waterfall Model:

Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing sequentially, suitable for projects with well-defined requirements but less adaptable to change.

4)Agile Model:

Iterative and incremental approach emphasizing adaptability, customer collaboration, and delivering working software frequently.
Suited for projects with evolving or unclear requirements, allowing for flexibility and continuous improvement.
Teams work in short iterations, receiving feedback from customers and stakeholders to adjust priorities and features accordingly.
Waterfall Model:

Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing sequentially, from requirements gathering to deployment.
Suited for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where changes are less likely to occur.
Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, with limited flexibility to accommodate changes once a phase is finished.

Requirements engineering is the systematic process of gathering, documenting, analyzing, and validating software requirements, ensuring alignment between the software solution and business objectives.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.


Software Design Principles:
Software Design Principles:
Design principles like SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) promote modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Following these principles leads to cleaner, more robust codebases, facilitating easier maintenance and future enhancements.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in Software Design:
Modularity involves breaking down a software system into independent components or modules, enhancing maintainability and scalability by isolating changes and facilitating growth.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Testing in Software Engineering:
Testing verifies software meets requirements and functions correctly, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing, to identify and fix defects throughout development.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Software Testing Levels:

Unit Testing: Tests individual components to verify correctness, conducted by developers.
Integration Testing: Ensures integrated components work together, validating interactions.
System Testing: Validates entire software system against requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms software meets user expectations, typically by end-users.
Importance of Testing:
Testing identifies and fixes defects early, reducing costs and enhancing software quality and reliability. It validates requirements, mitigating risks and increasing customer satisfaction.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems:
